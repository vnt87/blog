So I've been fiddling around with remote management tools for my home server recently, after accidentally discovering [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) after installing Fedora (it comes preinstalled with [Fedora Server](https://getfedora.org/en/server/) 34), I started looking around for alternatives. Don't get me wrong Cockpit is great but being a DIY I always wanted to see what kind of options are out there.

During my search I came across a vaguely familiar name: [Webmin](https://www.webmin.com/). I had limited experience with Webmin before when I was searching for a decent web panel for my VPS since it is the basis on which [Virtualmin](https://www.virtualmin.com/) is based on. I quickly dropped it due to the horribly outdated UI (it's a designer's quirk, don't ask).

Revisiting it a few years later, I just couldn't believe my eyes when I first fire up the program, the difference is like Night and Day! Even literally more so since the current version even includes a proper dark mode that can be toggled in real time! How awesome is that?

Check out this before-after comparison:

This darkmode though, hot damn!
