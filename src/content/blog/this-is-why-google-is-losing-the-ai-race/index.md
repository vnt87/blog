It's August 2024, almost 2 years in since AI exploded. Flux.1 was just released and everyone is going nuts over it. Whether you have your own model like Luma or KlingAI or you're just hosting 3rd party models like CivitAI, Shakker, TensorArt...everyone is in a racing to market with whatever they have.

And then we have Google, the village idiot, still region locking their Imagen generator like it's April 1st, 2004. I mean I get it, they sunk billions of dollar into this race and only have an inferior model to show for it, even free & opensource models are leaving them in the dust. But gatekeeping's definitely not the solution to that.
