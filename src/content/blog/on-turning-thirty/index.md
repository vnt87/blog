To be honest, I thought turning 30 would be a bigger milestone, for me personally at least.

I mean, I don’t have anything to complain about my current situation per se, I have a job that I enjoy, a wife that I love, a house. Honestly this is as good as any 30er would get. But is that all there is? I mean is this going to be like this for the rest of my life. Like that old saying, you know? “Some people are dead by 30, but never buried until they’re 75″.
