So one of my fellow designer recently posted this:

Basically one of his client saidthis

> Using repetitive layout patterns in app design in order to improve learnability is just an excuse for being lazy at creativity.

And that raises an interesting question (for me anyway): just what is "Creativity", anyway?

Now I'm not talking about its literal definition, we all have our own intepretation of what it is. I'm talking about how we - the people in the design community - perceive it.

Graphic designers, product designers, illustrators, painters, UI/UX designers, visual GFX artists, game artists etc. we're own thrown into the same blanket category: "Creatives" they call us. But that word, Creativity, it's not the same thing for all of us.

For graphic designers, illustrators, painters...Creativity is a goal, the ultimate destination where you want to take your creations

For UI/UX/Product designers...Creativity is a tool, and as with any other tool, you only wield it to serve a purpose. And in our case, that purpose is Usability.

Think about it, if you're an artists, a painter, your work doesn't really serve anyone else but your own creators, and those who follow their visions. The ultimate validation of your works is its creativity.

But as a product designer, your work serves other purposes

In conclusion, to answer the question: is it bad if your creation is not super innovative?

I'd say it depends on the purpose of your creation.

If it's for show, then yes

If it's for use, then no.
