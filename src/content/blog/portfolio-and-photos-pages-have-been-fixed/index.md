So as you may or may not be aware, the [Portfolio](https://namvu.net/works/) page and the [Photography](https://namvu.net/photography/) page have been broken for the longest time, well today I managed to finally fix them. I'm not going to use the old "too busy" excuse to justify why they've been broken for so long (although it's true), but I couldn't for the life of me figure out why the shortcodes couldn't parse. So eventually I decided to say f\*ck it and decided to nuke everything and restore from an old backup from last year, which somehow magically fixed those pages (and also the bug where the 3D effect doesn't work on Firefox, don't ask me how).

Anyway now that they're back, I should probably update them with more recent works. I don't think I've added anything new for several years.

Here's hoping I don't take another year before getting around to actually doing it.

Okay first one down, 34 more to go. (oh yeah btw, I may have nuked my entire home server along with over 30 services running on it including Phimhub because I trusted ChatGPT to handle docker management, lesson well learned)
