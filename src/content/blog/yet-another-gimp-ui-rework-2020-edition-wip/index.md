After all these years, I've come to the fact that GIMP is now a lost cause. It used to be a 'Photoshop alternative', but after years of stagnation it's now having its butt kicked by even another open source image editor (Krita).

Nonetheless it's still one of my all-time favorite editor, mostly due to nostalgia's sake (I was a well-known tutorial writer back in the 2000s for the GIMP, you know, back when written tutorials were still a thing). And I especially take joy in reworking its UI. This, I do admit, is due to that fact that its interface is so godawful that ANY changes you make to it is an improvement. Whenever I feel bored or depressed, I rework

I did a GIMP UI rework some odd years ago. The project never finished due to time constraints, as I had other obligations to attend to. But that was when designers were creating UIs on Photoshop (I shivers as I remember those times). I think I blew like a week on that project. Fun times, hah.

Times had changed. We have dedicated UI design tools these days. I spent like a few hours on Figma already have more progress than I did in a week with the last project. And this was done completely on Linux! Something that was impossible the last time.

Here's a quick sneak peak of the current WIP.

<!--more-->

**Feb 18 2020**:

1. Added sample artwork in main work area
2. Added ruler (man this would've been a bitch to work with if Figma didn't implement Autoflow)
3. Dock the toolset to the left instead of letting it float (there will be a dual-column undocked version later)
4. Modify the text in the bottom info bar to resemble actual useful information

Also, for the record, my design is open source and can be freely accessed on Figma at [this URL](https://www.figma.com/file/hWyVbX2yGHzpkO3R25Hpug/NeoGIMP?node-id=88%3A1082)
