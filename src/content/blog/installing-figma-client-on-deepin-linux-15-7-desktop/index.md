Grab install.sh from [this Github](https://github.com/carloslfu/figma-app-linux/blob/master/install.sh) and just run it.

It's that simple, really. This is why the opensource community is great. The Figma team had failed to create a native Linux desktop app for over 2 years (which is still nothing compare to [Google on their promise to launch a Google Drive client for Linux](https://abevoelker.github.io/how-long-since-google-said-a-google-drive-linux-client-is-coming/)), and yet an unknown individual managed to do it in his/her spare time.

Why would you need a desktop app when Figma works in your browser, you ask? Here's a hint: Native Font! I mean Figma did a great job integrating Google Fonts in their app (I figure that would be sufficient for 90% web-related design work). But any real designer would have to have their own font collection, and not being able to use it in their favorite design tool is just bad design.

Note: if for some reason the install script fails, you can always download a premade AppImage for Figma from the same Github
