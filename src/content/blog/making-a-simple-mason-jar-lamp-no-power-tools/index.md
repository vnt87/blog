So I recently came across one of these neat little lamp thingy at one of the local novelty shop. They’re cute but their price tag ain’t, running something like 800k VND (around $39) for 3 of them. Granted of course their craftmanship is top notch, but being a cheapskate I still decided I’d try to make a knockoff from all the junks I have around the house

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1080"\]![](images/cVcovAa.jpg) Required stuffs: You gonna need a jar and a spare light socket + light bulb laying around. Preferably an Edison bulb but any thing could work really. Here I have a 4w LED light bulb which is probably a tad too bright for this particular jar.\[/caption\]

 

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1080"\]![](images/YwdgLxE.jpg) Ok first grab a pair of compasses, use it to measure the circumference of the light socket, then draw it on the lid of the jar like so\[/caption\]

 

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1080"\]![](images/CzyUcBh.jpg) Then use a throwaway knife and a hammer to perforate the lid, like so\[/caption\]

 

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1080"\]![](images/sKh2dsw.jpg) Use a screwdriver and pull away the center part. Yes I realize there might be less peasantry ways to do this, but I make do with the tools that I have available\[/caption\]

 

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1080"\]![](images/LOpCcdj.jpg) Try to fit the light socket in, yep, like a glove. You're almost done, now there's only 1 more sensible thing to do...\[/caption\]

 

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1080"\]![](images/rtpKNNW.jpg) ...that is of course, to spray paint the shit out of both the lid and the top part of the light socket. Because having matching color stuffs is important, and not peasantry at all\[/caption\]

 

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1080"\]![](images/FFBmyrl.jpg) Now just put everything together and you have your shitty little mason jar lamp. It may look only moderately pretty at first, but when you realize it costs close to 1/10th the price of the store-bought version, suddenly it looks like a frigging piece of art.\[/caption\]

 

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="720"\]![](images/CiDxcT5.jpg) Whole thing costed like $3 lol\[/caption\]

 

Next step: make a whole damn chandelier out of this stuff
