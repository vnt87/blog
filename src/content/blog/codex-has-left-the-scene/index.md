Even though I don't really have time to play video games anymore these days, I still deeply respect these scene groups and what they did to make life enjoyable for millions of underprivileged children.

For those who didn't get the subtle callouts in the text:

<!--more-->

_"The blade has been dull for a long time."_ = **RAZOR 1911**

_"Quality, tradition and pride was slowly fading to darkness"_ = **FLT** (QUALITY, TRADITION AND PRIDE is the slogan in [their NFO](https://imgur.com/9fo8hWX))

_"there is a particular group that uses an old name without permission."_ = **SKIDROW** (when they were reborn in 2007, there was [drama surrounding the use of the SKIDROW name](https://nfomation.net/info/1645650034.skidrow.nfo))

_"they really should have closed down years ago after all the spectacular fuckups they are responsible for"_ = also **SKIDROW** (for years, they had a history of releasing [bad cracks](https://nfomation.net/info/1645656111.flt.nfo), [stolen cracks](https://nfomation.net/info/1645656169.reloaded.nfo), [incorrectly nuking/propering other groups](https://nfomation.net/info/1645656238.flt.nfo), [etc](https://nfomation.net/info/1645656310.flt.nfo))

_"people resurrecting and adopting old names from previously busted groups"_ = **HOODLUM** (busted during [Operation Site Down in 2005](https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2005/June/05_crm_353.htm))
