I've always been fascinated by these old terminal when playing Fallout. In reality I've only ever seen them once or twice in my life. Most of the images I find on the web are 3D renders.

So I've been thinking about building one myself, DIY style. Right now I have a few spare parts available, an old AMD 5600K CPU-Mobo-Ram combo and an old IBM ThinkVision L150 monitor. All I need to build is a housing to put they all inside.

Problem is, I only own a few primitive hand tool, and my skill with them leaves a lot to be desired. Creating those curves probably gonna be quite a challenge. Not to mention the engineering works.

So maybe something like this SVM Commander 3D render?

Or maybe one of these real models?

The possibilities are endless. Argh I've been losing sleep over these.
